# Work Day Scheduler

## My Task
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story 
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner, so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
- When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event.
- When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
